## Requirements
* Git
* GitHub Account
* IDE/Text Editor

Open a terminal shell or git-scm terminal and clone the repository to your computer using the Git command:
	
	git clone https://github.com/[username]/[RepositoryName].git

Next, open the project with your preferred text editor or IDE and complete the assignment according to your trainer’s instructions or Readme. When you are ready to submit your assignment, add, commit, and push your changes using the git commands:

```
	git add .
	git commit -m “completed question #X”
	git push
```

Be sure not to alter the folder structure, configuration files, or unit tests of the assignment.
